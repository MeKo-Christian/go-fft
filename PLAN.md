## Notes

- Each phase is designed to be completable in approximately one focused day
- Phases can be parallelized where dependencies allow
- Testing and documentation are integrated throughout, not afterthoughts
- Performance optimization happens incrementally, not all at once
- API stability is prioritized to avoid breaking changes for users
